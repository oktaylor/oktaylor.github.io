My research is centered at the intersection of computer vision, multi-modal learning, and event-based vision, with a focus on facial analysis and eye tracking. I develop novel frameworks that using both event and RGB data, such as creating cross-modal fusion attention modules for facial keypoint alignment and adapting remote eye tracking systems for facial data. My research combines deep learning theory with practical implementation to address challenges in high-speed, dynamic visual understanding, such as gaze tracking for driver monitoring, and AR/XR systems.</p> <p>I completed my B.S. in Electronic and Electrical Engineering from Hongik University. During my undergraduate studies, I served as an Undergraduate Research Assistant in the same lab, where my work focused on improving pupil detection robustness under large head rotations and exploring the use of human pose estimation for Korean Sign Language translation in medical contexts.</p> <p>Beyond my core research, I have gained extensive practical experience through the Naver Boostcamp AI Tech program, contributing to a variety of projects involving video privacy masking , semantic segmentation of medical images , object detection , and multi-label image classification. Moving forward, I aim to apply and expand my expertise to tackle challenges at the intersection of human cognition, gaze, and robotics, with the goal of developing systems that can more intuitively understand and interact with people.</p> <p>For a comprehensive overview of my work, please see my <a href="/al-folio/publications/">list of publications</a>.
